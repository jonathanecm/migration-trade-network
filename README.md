Explores the connection between trade and migration flows.


This project does:
- Combines data from the World Bank, The International Trade Center, and the International Migration Institute.
- Uses R scripts to clean the data.
- Uses R scripts to construct three networks: migration flow, trade, and FDI in four different point in time: 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.
- Uses centrality measures, of directional nature, at the actor level.
- Uses network analysis software Gephi version 0.9.1.
- Implements a topology Degree Range set a 1.
- Uses two layout algorithms: Yifam Hu, and Fruchterman Raingold.
- Uses statistics for analysis: Average Weighted Degree, and Network Diameter.
- Partition the nodes according to measures of centrality: Weighted Out-Degree, Weighted In-Degree, Betweenness and Closeness Centrality.
